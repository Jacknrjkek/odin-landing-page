Project: Landing Page

Welcome to the README of my web design project. Below is a concise summary of the tasks and objectives I pursued.

Overview

For this project, I was tasked with developing a web page based on two provided design images:

Complete Website Layout: An image that displays the overall design of the website.
Design Details: Another image revealing specifics regarding fonts and colors used.
Key Instructions

Reference and Research:
If I didn't remember or was unfamiliar with certain aspects, I was encouraged to look them up.
Using tools like Google was highlighted as a common practice among professionals.
There were design details that I hadn't encountered in past lessons. To tackle these, I leveraged online resources, such as looking up "CSS rounded corners".
Precision vs. Practicality:
My aim was to match the design as closely as feasible, but achieving perfection wasn't the primary goal.
I didnâ€™t stress about measuring exact pixels or being overly precise with margins.
Variations, such as using a margin: 24px even if the design suggests margin: 48px, were deemed acceptable.
Personal Touch:
The design I was provided with contained placeholder content. I took the liberty to substitute this with my own content.
I customized the page by integrating real images and made adjustments to colors and fonts to suit my personal or hypothetical business theme.
Getting Started

Break Down the Design: Before diving into coding, I dissected the design into distinct sections and components.
Progressive Development: I consistently tested the web page to gauge how my rendition was shaping up and made necessary adjustments.
Personalization: I prepared in advance by collating any personalized content or resources I intended to use.
Final Thoughts

This project was a valuable experience, urging me to utilize what I've learned and complement it with independent research to emulate a design. I embraced the challenges, learned from any hurdles, and enjoyed the entire development process!

Happy to share my journey!
